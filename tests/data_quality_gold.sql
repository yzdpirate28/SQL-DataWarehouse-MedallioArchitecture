Quality Checks
===============================================================================
Script Purpose:
    This script performs quality checks to validate the integrity, consistency, 
    and accuracy of the Gold Layer. These checks ensure:
    - Uniqueness of surrogate keys in dimension tables.
    - Referential integrity between fact and dimension tables.
    - Validation of relationships in the data model for analytical purposes.

Usage Notes:
    - Investigate and resolve any discrepancies found during the checks.

-- Checking 'gold.dim_customers'
-- ====================================================================
-- Purpose: Ensure that each customer_key in gold.dim_customers is unique.
-- Expectation: No rows should be returned (no duplicates).
SELECT 
    customer_key,
    COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count
FROM gold.dim_customers
GROUP BY customer_key
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- ====================================================================
-- Checking 'gold.dim_products'
-- ====================================================================
-- Purpose: Ensure that each product_key in gold.dim_products is unique.
-- Expectation: No rows should be returned (no duplicates).
SELECT 
    product_key,
    COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count
FROM gold.dim_products
GROUP BY product_key
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- ====================================================================
-- Checking 'gold.fact_sales' relationships
-- ====================================================================
-- Purpose: Validate referential integrity between fact_sales and dimensions.
-- Expectation: No rows should be returned (all foreign keys have matching dimensions).
